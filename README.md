# HairConnect


HairConnect is an innovative on-demand web application connecting residents in Calgary with skilled barbers and hairdressers offering premium salon services at home. Leveraging the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and integrating real-time geolocation, the app enables seamless user experiences. I designed and implemented robust backend functionalities, including user authentication, data storage, and geospatial queries. I crafted intuitive user interfaces on the frontend, allowing effortless browsing, booking, and payment processes.
